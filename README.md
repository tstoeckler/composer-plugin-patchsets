# Composer Plugin Patchsets

This is an unmaintained fork of
[github.com/wieni/composer-plugin-patchsets](https://github.com/wieni/composer-plugin-patchsets).
See that for the general documentation.

This fork attempts to fix automatically re-patching dependencies when the patch
repositories are updated as well as automatically patching all dependencies on
initial install.

This fork was abandoned because it does not work in some cases and in general
it was deemed more feasible to call `composer patches-relock` and/or
`composer patches-repatch` at the appropriate places manually rather than 
maintaining this fork. Feel free to use the code, however, or open an issue if
you want to make a case for actually making this a properly maintained plugin.

As of now, this fork is not published on [Packagist](https://packagist.org).
